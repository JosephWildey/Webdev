# Webdev
I am using this repository for webdev tutorials, including HTML and other stuff. You should be able to create a fully functional website
when I am done. With all sorts of neat elements. These tutorials are not comprehensive because no matter how much I write you will have
to google stuff from time to time at 3 AM. If you need a comprehensive resource I recommend something like w3schools.com. However, 
I am self-taught in Web design and if I tried to list every resource possible it'd take all day AND it's quite possible some of those
sources would either be obsolete or inaccessible. That is the nature of the internet and self-study. Unfortunately, if you are not clever
or already well known for what you know it is also the nature of portfolios.
